# Server Nuker
Are you pissed at a server that your staff in? 

Do you fucking hate the server owner?

Do you want to watch ~~the world~~ a Discord server burn?

Well I got the perfect program for you! Server Nuker!

Server Nuker is a powerful Node.js program that will destroy any Discord server that you have Admin/Mod/Staff in.

# Disclaimer


This program is **very powerful.** It runs **very fast** on small servers (less than 250 members). And it only takes a minute to **ban everyone in the server, and delete all roles/channels.**. **I am not responsible** for any damage you do with this tool, or any punishments you get from the server owners, **or even Discord Staff (They could ban your account for API abuse)**. Please use this tool on an alt account or on a bot account. Don't fucking blame me if your server got nuked with this.


# Install

Download this repo as a .zip file

Uzip the .zip file to a folder 

Open config.json and put your user token in the config.json file.

Run the command `npm install` in the folder

Then run `node index.js`

Once the program has connected to the API, run one of the commands below in te server you want to destroy.
# Commands

`!destroy` -**Bans everyone, deletes all channels and roles, and sets the server name to a raided message.**

`!overwrite` - Does the same thing as `!destroy`, but creates tons of channels and roles. Useful if you don't want the server owners to be able to recover from this.

`!baneveryone` - Bans everyone.

`!deletechannels` Deletes all channels.
