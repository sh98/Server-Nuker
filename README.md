# Server Nuker
Are you a pissed off kid with no life?

Do you wanna waste somebody's time?

Do you want to watch Kyle's Discord server burn?

Well I got the perfect program for you! Server Nuker!

Server Nuker is a powerful Node.js program that will destroy any Discord server that you have Admin/Mod/Staff in.

# Disclaimer


I have over 100 alts, feel free to blame me.


# Install

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

Download this repo as a .zip file

Uzip the .zip file to a folder 

Open config.json and put your user token in the config.json file.

Run the command `npm install` in the folder

Then run `node index.js`

Once the program has connected to the API, run one of the commands below in te server you want to destroy.
# Commands

`!destroy` -**Bans everyone, deletes all channels and roles, and sets the server name to a raided message.**

`!overwrite` - Does the same thing as `!destroy`, but creates tons of channels and roles. Useful if you don't want the server owners to be able to recover from this.

`!baneveryone` - Bans everyone.

`!deleteroles` Deletes all roles.

`!deletechannels` Deletes all channels.
